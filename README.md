From $\phi ^4$ Theory to QCD: Investigating HMC and SMD Algorithms Code Repository.

## Abstract
 This project aimed to use a toy model as a means to explore novel numerical simulation techniques for lattice field theory. The HMC algorithm has been the traditional method in performing lattice field theory calculations, but recently the Stochastic molecular dynamics (SMD) algorithm has been introduced. A key question that remains to be answered is which algorithm performs better in sampling field space. The goal of this project was to calculate expectation values of observables in $\phi^4$ theory using the HMC algorithm and the SMD. The auto-correlation times of the observables in each algorithm is used to study the efficiency/accuracy of the two algorithms.
